      "Grocery delivery services are booming and they all only talk about one thing: speed. With a different approach, a very slow one, Gorillas serves up an arthouse short film called Red Cabbage on YouTube that is about as long as the Gorillas delivery time: 8 minutes."

    "description2": "Red Cabbage tells the story of Rod Kohl, who gets forgotten on a night bus and meets all sorts of strangers. He takes the audience into a cosmos that is very popular with the young target group and in which time doesn't matter: the Berlin night.",

Tinder aims to shift this perspective by suggesting that there isn't just one perfect match for each of us; instead, anyone could be \"the one\" — whether they are the funny one, the attractive one, or the intelligent one. To illustrate this, we imagined a Waldo puzzle made entirely of Waldos, symbolizing how effortlessly you can find not just one, but many perfect matches."
